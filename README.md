## Instructions

1. Locate your `CodeWalker.exe.config` in the root of your CodeWalker folder. (Right-click your exe file to go to the folder easily.)
2. Overwrite the existing file (`CodeWalker.exe.config`) in the root of your CodeWalker folder with the file from [here](https://github.com/iplayer1337fivem/codewalkerTweaks/tree/main/modified).
3. Open/EDIT with VS or NP+ and copy/paste from this file to the existing one or just overwrite it with the `CodeWalker.exe.config` from the [modified](https://github.com/iplayer1337fivem/codewalkerTweaks/blob/main/modified/CodeWalker.exe.config) folder. If you want to tweak it further, do it [here](https://github.com/iplayer1337fivem/codewalkerTweaks/tree/main/modified).
4. To revert to the standard/reset configuration, follow step 1, and then go to this repository folder [here](https://github.com/iplayer1337fivem/codewalkerTweaks/tree/main/standard), overwrite it, and you will be back to the standard configuration.
5. Restart CodeWalker every time you switch the config to execute the changes.
6. Enjoy an easier life.
